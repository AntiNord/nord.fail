        <p>Ah i've been expecting you... you're probably here because you have asked a question about nordvpn.</p>
        <p>If you are considering spending money on Nord VPN then please reconsider,<br>almost all the good reviews have been "sponsered" by Nord VPN.</p>
        <p>Not only are their servers slow and often detected by sites such as Netflix but they also:<br><br>

            - Commit price discrimination<br>
            - Pay media companies for 5 star reviews<br>
            - Tried to cover up that one of their servers got hacked.<br>
            - Hiding their past company history<br>
            - Affiliated with a data mining company<br><br>

            Suprisingly this isn't the whole list, more can be found <a href="https://blog.httpjames.space/nordvpn-is-a-shitvpn">here</a> (credit to James).<br>
